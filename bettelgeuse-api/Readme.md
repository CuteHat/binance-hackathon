# Web3 Reputation API

The Web3 Reputation API is an API for the web3-reputation project. The API systematically listens to the project's
contracts, captures events, and updates information in the database. It also manages NFT Metadata creation and update
flow, which involves generating a new image for NFT as well. The Metadata and images are stored on IPFS. In addition,
the API communicates with ChatGPT OpenAI to generate suggestions for users.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Web3 Reputation API, simply download the project and click run. No preconfiguration is needed.
